    <div class="c1"><p class="p2">Dealer gives one card at a time face down, beginning with the player on the left. When two people play, each person gets 10 cards. When three or four people play, each receives seven cards; when five or six play, each receives six cards. The remaining cards are placed face down on the table, forming the stock.
<br>
The top card of the stock is turned face up and becomes the upcard. It is placed next to the stock to start the discard pile.
<br>
When two people play, the winner of each hand deals the next. When more than two play, the deal passes to next the player on the left.
