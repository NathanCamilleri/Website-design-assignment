    <div class="c1"><p class="p2">The player to the left of the dealer goes first. Play then moves clockwise.

On his turn, each player turns over the top card from his face-down pile. When someone turns over a card that matches a card already face up on another player’s pile, players race to be the first to call “Snap!”. The player who calls “Snap!” first wins both piles and adds them to the bottom of his face-down pile.

When a player calls “Snap!” at the wrong time, he must give his top card to the player who just played. If a player makes a mistake on his own turn, he must give his top card to the player on his right.

Play continues until one player wins all of the cards. That player wins the game.</p>\
