Once the bet is placed, you will see a deck of cards lying face down. Your task is to predict the suit of the top card (diamond, hearts, spades, or clubs). Some games can ask for predicting the color (red or black) instead of the suit. Obviously, it is even better as your chances to guess double;<br>
